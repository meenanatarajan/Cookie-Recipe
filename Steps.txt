Peanut Butter steps

Put dough in refrigerator for 1 hour.

Matcha Cookies:

    Melt butter in a bath or microwave.
    Add white sugar, brown sugar and salt and mix with a whisk
    Add egg and vanilla extract and mix with a whisk until well mixed.
    Add flour, matcha powder and baking soda and mix with a whisk until you can hardly see the powder.
    Add white coverture chocolate and macadamia and mix evenly with spatula.
    Allow 30 minutes to 1 hour in the refrigerator until the dough hardens.

    Pan with a 5cm diameter cookie and bake at 170°C (338°F) for 9 minutes. (Unox convection oven)

    Preheat the oven beforehand. My oven is very hot, so raise the oven temperature a little bit higher if you have common oven.
    If you bake too little, it will not be cooked. If you bake too long, it will become hard.
    The white coverture chocolate melts smoothly in your mouth, and the white chocolate chip has a more chewy texture. So you can choose anything to your taste.
